# Script Panel for Blender

[Script Panel](https://github.com/rBrenick/script-panel) rewritten from the ground up for Blender.

![header image](docs/header_image.png)

Designed to be used in a studio environment for sharing simple scripts between artists. Any python files added to one of the defined root paths automatically shows up as a button in the UI.


Button customization options:
- Button label
- Search and pick from existing blender icon
    - Or set a custom icon .png path
- Tooltips
- Favoriting
- Save changes to a shared .json file (or as a local override .json)


The local .json changes are applied on top of the shared .json.


Inspiration from [brave rabbits' toolShelf](https://www.braverabbit.com/braverabbit/tools/toolshelf/) but with a slightly different flavor to it.
